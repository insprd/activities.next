## Setup

Follow [this document](docs/setup.md) to setup your local server

### Host it on Vercel

Fork the project and setup Vercel to the Github repo and add
below environment variables

```
ACTIVITIES_HOST=domain.tld,
ACTIVITIES_DATABASE='{"type":"sql","client":"better-sqlite3","useNullAsDefault":true,"connection":{"filename":"./dev.sqlite3"}}'
ACTIVITIES_SECRET_PHASE='random-hash-for-cookie'
ACTIVITIES_ALLOW_EMAILS='[]'
ACTIVITIES_ALLOW_MEDIA_DOMAINS='[]'
ACTIVITIES_AUTH='{"github":{"id":"GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID","secret":"GITHUB_APP_SECRET"}}'
```

Change the database client to your database type e.g. pg and update
the connection with your database configuration.
