## Setup

Follow [this document](docs/setup.md) to setup your local server

### Host it on Vercel

Fork the project and setup Vercel to the Github repo and add
below environment variables

```
ACTIVITIES_HOST=domain.tld
ACTIVITIES_DATABASE='{"type":"sql","client":"better-sqlite3","useNullAsDefault":true,"connection":{"filename":"./dev.sqlite3"}}'
ACTIVITIES_SECRET_PHASE='random-hash-for-cookie'
ACTIVITIES_ALLOW_EMAILS='[]'
ACTIVITIES_ALLOW_MEDIA_DOMAINS='[]'
ACTIVITIES_AUTH='{"github":{"id":"GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID","secret":"GITHUB_APP_SECRET"}}'
ACTIVITIES_EMAIL='{"type":"smtp","host":"email-smtp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com","port":465,"secure":true,"debug":true,"serviceFromAddress":"Service <email@domain.tld>","auth":{"user":"username","pass":"password"}}'
```

Change the database client to your database type e.g. pg and update
the connection with your database configuration.

### Host with Docker

When running the docker image, provides these variables

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your.domain.tld
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=session secret
ACTIVITIES_HOST=your.domain.tld
ACTIVITIES_SECRET_PHASE='random-hash-for-cookie'
ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_TYPE=sql
ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite3
ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_SQLITE_FILENAME=data.sqlite
```

If you don't provide the database config, the database will persist in container
in the path `/opt/activities.next/data.sqlite`. You can mount this file out when
starting the container too.
